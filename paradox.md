Automated translation promised a period of prosperity for the profession where increased productivity would create an explosion of demand. Instead, there are signs of a downturn. This year has been marked by stories of declining revenues among translation companies and the downsizing or elimination of in-house localization teams. While I cannot disclose many private cases, here are public examples from listed Language Service Providers (LSPs) that illustrate this trend.

## Examples of Decline

* RWS reported a 10% sales drop in regulated industries. Regulated includes legal, life sciences, and patent translations - some of the traditional services of LSPs (RWS FY24 Results)
* Straker's report shows a -11% revenue decline despite the company being a leading tech disruptor. The gains from new AI workflows and clients have yet to ramp up and offset declines in more traditional business lines (Straker FY25 Interim Results).
Honyaku Center in Japan reported a stagnant core translation business (0%) while interpretation services grew (Honyaku Center Highlights).
* At TAUS Albuquerque, Marco Trombetti stated that Translated saw a 29% growth driven by pure AI enterprise business. However, demand from small and medium businesses using their website remained stagnant.
* Arle Lommel at CSA Research found that traditional translation sales fell 16.3% over five years, and post-editing has not fully compensated for this decline (CSA Research).

These are all examples from large companies, and it is the smaller, traditional businesses that have been affected more. Surveys from Nimdzi, Slator, and CSA may confirm the extent of the gap, but the signs are here, the current evidence points to a concerning trend. 

With machine translation (MT) enabling more content to be translated at lower costs, logic suggests the volume should explode. However, this has not materialized. What's happening?

## Jevon's Paradox

Watt's steam engine - an innovation that changed coal
Let’s turn our clocks back 160 years. In the 19th century England James Watt introduced a more efficient steam engine. Coal magnates feared their business would contract because buyers needed less fuel. But the opposite happened. With a Watt, it took less coal to run any factory or a transport vehicle, and one could do more with less: manufacture more goods cost-efficiently, travel further, and heat longer. The demand for coal skyrocketed, it triggered the Industrial Revolution and made coal mining a bigger business than ever. Later, an English economist William Jevons observed this economic mechanism and named it after himself. 

Jevon’s Paradox occurs when the demand increases at twice the speed of cost reduction. Applying this to translation, if AI reduces costs by 30%, demand would need to increase by 60% to trigger similar growth. Six years ago, Konstantin Savenkov predicted that MT would spark unparalleled growth in global translation volume following the model discovered by Jevons. Yet, this revolution remains unrealized.

## The World Needs More Translation

Machine translation has transformative potential. Never before were we so connected, so able to communicate and understand each other across language barriers. There aren’t enough human translators on Earth to be there on-demand in every conversation and phone call, every foreign website visit, every “find out directions” interaction in a city abroad. MT makes such feats possible.

In business, the localization sector has significant room for growth. Cross-border companies often translate only a fraction of their content. For example, in 2024, John Yunker noted that the top 25 globalized websites supported 58 languages on average (Byte Level Research), and when a language is supported, CSA estimates that < 20-30% of online content is translated. 

In an ideal world, translation would be universal, with every website, textbook, and app available in every language.

So why are many translation companies struggling instead of thriving?


## Factors Behind the Decline

1. Document Translation shifted to apps

Pro-consumer translation demand—such as document translation for legal offices, public sector entities, and general business—is decreasing as users adopt tools like ChatGPT and DeepL. Examples include:

Legal Offices: Many have shifted to MT for gisting purposes, bypassing agencies.
Public Sector: Governments worldwide are integrating MT into their systems, such as the EU’s eTranslation platform and Minnesota’s Enterprise Translation Office adding a ChatGPT translator (story by Slator).

Exceptions exist, such as in the life sciences sector, where high stakes of health hazards from an AI system hallucination discourage reliance on MT.

LSPs that target cost-sensitive document translation segments are seeing their opportunities diminishing. Half-joking, I estimate that each million of DeepL's revenue wipes out 50 million of translation companies' revenue.

2. Cost-cutting in Enterprise Localization

In-house language teams historically struggled to sell the idea that translation brings a direct return on investment (ROI). Instead, many teams formed a perception of a cost center, and costs must be trimmed.

Successful language teams implemented technology and optimized workflows, getting better quality faster at a lower price per word. They worked hard and brought in savings, and top managers diverted these savings from localization to other cost centers, such as marketing and engineering. Hearing from localization managers at Dell, Google, and other large companies at industry conferences over the last two years I couldn't help but notice that many declined in overall budget, instead of ramping up languages. In other words, loc departments bled budgets.

3. Translation as a Feature - added by Product Owners and Developers

Fully automated translation in the enterprise is growing fast - confirmed by the boom of MT at DeepL, Lilt, ModernMT, Smartling, WeGlot, and similar companies. Furthermore, the latest stories with "Translation as a Feature" mean that product officers and developers in digital companies are more interested than ever in MT. 

Some examples:

* Reddit added sitewide French AI translation and indexed all of their translated content in Google search. Revenue in the last quarter jumped 48%, and unique users grew 37%.
* Coursera launched a massive AI translation project in January 2024, and 4,200 lectures have been translated into 21 languages
Oracle announced a new AI-powered translation feature in drug pharmacovigilance product Argus in October
* Roblox launched AI translation in February 2024 for chat between players, game text, and documentation. Engagement increased, reaching +6% daily time in some markets, and RBX stock jumped 16% on the news.
* In 2023, Canva added Canva Translate for multilingual designs within the app. Today 60% of Canva’s 175+ million active monthly users are international.

The more MT embedded in platforms becomes a familiar habit for the current generation of decision-makers, the less reason for going through a manual process, budget, and human review. Occasional mistranslations and hallucinations nonetheless.

## The Consequences

There is no stopping automated translation. To evolve and trigger Jevon's Paradox, translation teams must adapt and find a way to convince buyers to maintain a high level of human oversight and to keep investing in more languages.

As things stand, we will continue seeing segments of the translation market slowly melting away, hitting small businesses and cost-sensitive clients first with their power waning, in-house localization teams will spend less on services and technology, prompting vendors to cater more to marketing and product people entrepreneurs will focus on services other than translation, diversifying into interpreting, content creation, design.

I hope upcoming annual research from the industry's think tanks will explore this trend in more detail: identify top LSP translation revenue, see its historical evolution, and provide their forecasts for 2025. For everyone else, the thought of the day: in 2000s, there was room for 2000+ significant translation agencies and 50000-100000 micro-businesses around the world. With technology products, the competition is much more severe, in every category fewer than 10 tools reach prominence and can compete. The world only supports 4-5 big operating systems, 3 Office suites, and a single big search engine, although 1500 smaller ones exist. 

How many translation organizations will be needed after the market crystallizes?
